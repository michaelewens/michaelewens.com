##### Gender Equity in Private Equity

We are building a comprehensive database of private equity professionals, their demographics and career trajectories.  [The goal](https://genderequityinpe.com/): to describe gender representation and understand the constraints faced by under-represented workers in the industry.  [The draft report](https://genderequityinpe.com/female-investment-professionals-in-us-private-equity/) was released in September 2024.

##### Blue Sky Law Data

[This website](https://blueskylaws.org/) provides the background and data for the NSF-funded “The Impact of Securities Regulation on Financial Development and Entrepreneurship” (1949582). The project aims to document the history of state securities laws from 1948 to 1980 (some gaps), characterize the stringency of those laws over time, and then connect the laws’ characteristics to economic outcomes.  The main data is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/michaelewens/Blue-Sky-Laws/tree/master).

##### Summer PhD Workshop on Entrepreneurial Finance

[This week-long workshop](https://entrepreneurial.finance/summer-phd-workshop-on-entrepreneurial-finance/) roughly follows the structure of the Entrepreneurial Finance Ph.D. course described on this site with several modifications. We will cover the major topics from the 6-week in-person course and highlight key institutional details required for successful entrepreneurial finance research. Several sessions will focus on the “how” of research, key databases used in the field, opportunities to present new ideas, and live examples of some data analysis in recent work. Students will have ample opportunities to interact with their peers and the participating faculty.

##### Entrepreneurial Finance: A PhD Course

[The course](https://entrepreneurial.finance/) aims to provide an overview of modern research in entrepreneurial finance and, more importantly, provide the foundation for success in producing research: mastering institutional details. These include definitions, industry norms, regulations (history of changes), laws, databases, disclosure rules, and more.

There is a hidden “literature” of these institutional details in all major empirical work. This course presents a literature review of sorts for these details while teaching entrepreneurial finance along the way.

##### Website Advice for Ph.D. Job Candidates

Recruiting season for econ and finance PhDs is about preparing your job market paper, writing your research statement, buying that new formal business attire, and practicing your job talk. You should also have a website, but not just any website. Email me for slides that I made for my students that job market candidates may find helpful.
